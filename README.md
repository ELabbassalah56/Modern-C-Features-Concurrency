Introduction to the Course 'Modern C++ Features & Concurrency'
Welcome to the course Modern C++ Features & Concurrency. The third of the 3 course Specialization in 
Complete Modern C++ (C++11/14/17)
.

The course is structured into five comprehensive modules:

C++ Concurrency: In this module, we will dive into the core concepts of C++ concurrency, beginning with thread creation and synchronization. You’ll explore various thread management techniques and task-based concurrency, learning how to handle shared data, exceptions, and synchronization across multiple threads.

C++17 Core Language Features: In this module, we will cover new core language features introduced in C++17, including deprecated features, streamlined syntax, and advanced function tools. You’ll learn how to leverage the latest updates to optimize your code and embrace modern C++ practices.

C++17 Template Features: In this module, we will explore the latest template features in C++17, from compiled time argument deduction (CTAD) to advanced fold expressions. By the end of this section, you'll be equipped with the tools to optimize templates and reduce complexity in your C++ code.

Function Wrappers: In this module, we will focus on function wrappers like std::function and std::bind, helping you manage callable objects and callbacks effectively. You will also learn best practices for handling function lifetimes and performance optimizations in C++.

C++17 Standard Library Components: In this module, we will introduce you to key C++17 standard library components such as std::optional, std::variant, and std::filesystem. You’ll also explore parallel algorithms to enhance performance and practical techniques for managing files and strings in C++17.

Target Learner: Ideal for experienced C++ developers looking to master modern features and concurrency techniques, with a solid understanding of C++ syntax and object-oriented programming.
